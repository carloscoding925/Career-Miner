            "description": "The Team:\nAt Amae we are a collective of healthcare leaders and technologists on a mission to create a radically different patient-first behavioral health care model that truly transforms patient’s lives by integrating care delivery, patient experience, cutting edge technology and research. Join a team of operators, builders and technologists from One Medical, Forward Health, Stanford, UCLA, Hinge Health, Palantir, The Four Seasons, and Brightline as we redefine care for the most vulnerable populations - across the nation, at scale. \nThe Opportunity: \nAs we expand our ability to care for complex patient populations, the core teams that support this work are also growing! We are seeking an Associate Software Engineer to help build and scale Amae Health’s patient and clinic facing technology platform. Central to shaping how patients and families access our precision psychiatry services, this role is fundamental to ensuring our solutions are both technically robust and adaptable to the evolving needs of care. As part of the technology team at Amae , you’ll help define how software development 3.0 can be harnessed responsibly in healthcare to expand access to life-changing care.\nAbout You:\nYou’re a full-stack engineer who thrives at the intersection of traditional engineering best practices and the emerging AI-native development paradigm. You’re fluent in writing and reviewing production-grade code, but you also bring discernment and pragmatism in how to integrate AI-generated code into a secure, reliable product.\nYou’re equally comfortable architecting backend systems as you are collaborating on frontend experiences. You take pride in mentoring peers, raising engineering standards, and ensuring code quality across the stack. You’re energized by the fast pace of early-stage work and motivated to build systems that directly improve mental health outcomes for patients and families.\nWhat you’ll work on: \nFull-Stack Development\n\nLead design, implementation, and review of features across the stack, with emphasis on scalable, secure, and maintainable architecture.\nBuild backend services, APIs, and frontend interfaces that power the patient experience.\nContribute to both backend and frontend, with flexibility to lean where your strengths are deepest.\n\nAI-Native Engineering (Software 3.0)\n\nLeverage LLMs and AI-native tooling to accelerate development while maintaining rigorous standards.\nApply strong code review practices to both human- and AI-generated contributions, ensuring correctness, security, and long-term maintainability.\nHelp define best practices for AI-augmented workflows in production-grade healthcare software.\n\nCollaboration\n\nPartner with product, design, and clinical teams to translate mental healthcare needs into intuitive software.\nParticipate in architectural discussions and guide the evolution of our platform.\n\nWhat you’ll have: \n\n1+ years of professional software engineering experience, with proven full-stack contributions\nStrong fundamentals in modern backend (Node.js, Python, or similar) and frontend frameworks, with Next.js experience preferred\nDeep familiarity with cloud-native environments (AWS & Vercel)\nPragmatic approach to code review: able to spot issues in both human- and AI-generated code, and guide teams toward best practices\nExcitement about “software development 3.0”—working AI-native, but with the maturity to know when traditional approaches are required\nCollaborative, mission-driven mindset, motivated to improve mental health outcomes at scale\nThis is a full-time in person role based in our San Francisco or Manhattan offices\n\nWhat we provide:\n\nHealth Insurance: Comprehensive medical, dental & vision plans\nCompetitive compensation\nEmployee Assistance Program\n401(k)\nFSA & HSA savings programs\nShort & long-term disability\nPre-tax commuter assistance program\nUnlimited paid time off (PTO)\nParental Leave - 12 weeks for birth and non birth parent\n11 company holidays\n\nAmae Health is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices.\nBase salary range for this role is $115,000 to $155,000 per year based on a full-time schedule and the compensation package will include equity. Actual compensation packages are based on several factors that are unique to each candidate's experience and professional leveling and it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range.
