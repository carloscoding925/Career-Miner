As both a trading firm and a tech firm, we have room for people who love to trade, people who love to program, and people everywhere in between. Nearly all of our traders write code, and many of our software engineers trade. The role you carve out for yourself will be largely dependent on your strengths and the types of problems you enjoy thinking about.\n \nResearchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of the trading and software engineering roles, this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.\n \nAbout You\n\nBe able to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems. Asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers\nWrite great code. We mostly write in OCaml, so you should want to learn functional programming if you don't already have experience with it\nHave good taste in research. The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers. You should be comfortable pushing in new and unknown directions while maintaining clarity of purpose\nThink and communicate precisely and openly. We believe great solutions come from the interaction between diverse groups of people across the firm\n \nIf you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to agency-partnerships@janestreet.com.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Base salary is $300,000.

We’ve always believed that developers should spend time and effort documenting their own code, but at the same time, a great writer with a feel for the technology can raise the level of quality in a way that few developers can. Establishing a culture of great docs is especially important as we grow.\nBuilding tools that support documentation. So much documentation is auto-generated by our systems, whether as error messages, logs, automated emails, or library docstrings. Getting your hands dirty hacking on documentation-adjacent tools will help not just to a first order, but will also make your other writing more effective.\nTraining material. We have a ton of programs that new and experienced hires go through, ranging from an OCaml Bootcamp to Dev Teach-ins that expose students to interesting technical problems from around the company. Part of the job is to make these better and mint more of them where valuable.\nWriting longer pieces. We need more tutorials and overviews on a variety of topics. We have an internal developer handbook that we’re writing, with a backlog of chapters—each one an opportunity to dive deep into some part of our stack. But there’s also a lot of external writing to be done, for instance on our blog, our programming podcast, for conferences, recruiting events, and more.\n\nIn terms of skills, we want someone who is both an excellent writer and good enough at programming to navigate our codebase, work through our tutorials, and write up examples. You might spend meaningful time embedded as an engineer on one of our projects, just to understand how we write software. But experience with functional programming, expressive type systems, OCaml, or finance are all unnecessary—we’re happy to teach you about these things here.\n \nIf you're a recruiting agency and want to partner with us, please reach out to agency-partnerships@janestreet.com.\n \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Base salary is $200,000 - $300,000.

You’ll be paired with experienced quantitative traders who will teach you how to identify market signals, analyze and execute strategies, construct quantitative models, conduct statistical analysis, and build trading intuition. \nYou'll work closely with two different mentors on projects relating to their day-to-day work, giving you a sense of the variety of problems we solve every day. Past projects have included analyzing new or existing datasets, training predictive models, simulating potential new trading strategies, writing tools that we use in production, and even working to answer big-picture questions we haven’t yet figured out.\nThis work is reinforced with intensive classes, workshops, and team-based mock trading sessions. These will expose you to many of the dynamics we observe in real markets, illustrate the role that we play in making markets more efficient, and help build intuition for how we think about both trading and collaborating.\nAt Jane Street, the lines between research, technology, and trading are intentionally blurry. As our strategies grow more sophisticated, close collaboration is essential for continuing to push the boundaries of what’s possible. We work with petabytes of data, a computing cluster with hundreds of thousands of cores, and a growing GPU cluster containing thousands of high-end GPUs. We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” modeling solutions; we are open to and excited about applying all different types of statistical and ML techniques, from linear models to deep learning, depending on what best fits a given problem.\nQuantitative trading interns also have the opportunity to participate in one “elective” based on your interests. Electives consist of targeted classes and immersive activities, and are designed to give you a deeper and more nuanced look into one of the many aspects of what quantitative trading can look like at Jane Street:\nMachine Learning, Modeling, and Data Science\nYou'll learn how Jane Street applies advanced machine learning and statistical techniques to make models and predictions using large datasets of both real and simulated market data. You'll learn how to train and use a variety of ML models, and gain an understanding of the differences between textbook machine learning and its application to noisy and complex financial data. \nAlgorithmic Trading and Market Microstructure\nYou'll learn the end-to-end process of developing an algorithmic trading strategy. You'll analyze market data to develop a tradable fair value and implement a trading strategy in Python. Your algorithmic strategy will connect directly to simulated markets with different market structures, and you will learn how to optimize your strategy given the unique attributes of each market. You will discover how various market dynamics affect strategy behavior and learn how real-world trading differs from simulation.\nTrading Strategy and Scenarios\nYou’ll be introduced to a rotating set of new trading scenarios inspired by real events on a particular trading desk. You’ll work in teams on multiple mock trading sessions related to each scenario and use the time between sessions to refine your strategies, write recaps, and hear how the story played out in real life from our seasoned full-time traders who lived through it.\nAbout You\nIf you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:\n\nA strong quantitative thinker (no specific degree or major is required)\nA clear and effective verbal and written communicator\nSomeone who enjoys working collaboratively on a team\nEager to ask questions, admit mistakes, and learn new things\n\nA profitable trading strategy is only as strong as the technology it runs on, and we consider ourselves as much a technology company as a trading firm.

You’ll work side by side with experienced ML Researchers on projects that we’ve selected for their combination of novel ML ideas and relevance to real-world systematic trading strategies. You'll learn how we think about markets through challenging classes and activities, and practice using established methods alongside our own unique twists to train practical models. \nAt Jane Street, the lines between research, technology, and trading are intentionally blurry. As our strategies grow more sophisticated, close collaboration is essential for continuing to push the boundaries of what’s possible. We work with petabytes of data, a computing cluster with hundreds of thousands of cores, and a growing GPU cluster containing thousands of high-end GPUs. Trading poses unusual challenges—large models and nonstationary datasets in a competitive multi-agent environment—that force us to search for novel techniques.\nYou’ll spend the bulk of your internship working closely with full-time machine learning researchers on projects drawn from their own work.  You might conduct an end-to-end study of an unexplored dataset, try a new modeling paradigm for a thorny problem, or consider blue-sky approaches that we’re still trying to figure out. The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers, and they often require insights from colleagues across the firm with different areas of expertise. Depending on the day, you might be diving deep into market data, tuning hyperparameters, debugging training issues, or analyzing the predictions your model makes.\nNote that given the IP-sensitive nature of machine learning research at Jane Street, it is unlikely that any research findings associated with the internship will be suitable for outside academic publication.\n \nAbout You\nIf you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.

We work on many different aspects of the compiler, aiming to make it easier for developers to express their ideas in OCaml, to improve the performance of the generated code, and to make the OCaml compiler itself faster and easier to use.\nOver the years, we extended the type system with support for novel language features, re-engineered the optimizer ground-up, and added feedback-directed optimization. We also extend and enhance the surrounding toolchain, working on tools for profiling, debugging, documenting, and building automation. The vast majority of our work is open-source, and we upstream as much as we can to the mainstream OCaml compiler.\nDuring the application process, we will work with you to identify a project that aligns with your research expertise and interests. Examples of areas we are interested in exploring include:\n\nType systems that track locality and uniqueness\nSuperoptimization\nCompiler testing and validation\n\nDuring the internship, you will work in collaboration with your mentors on one project for about 10-12 weeks. You'll learn how we use OCaml in our day-to-day work, and gain exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems. You'll gain a better understanding of the wide range of problems we solve every day. You'll try out new ideas and apply state-of-the-art research to a large actively-developed production codebase.\nYou'll also be able to access our physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and hopefully get a real sense of what it would be like to work here full-time.\nAbout You\nWe're looking for PhD and masters students with outstanding research experience in programming languages, compilers, verification, and related areas.

You’ll also learn how we use OCaml (our primary development language), F# (a similar language used with our Windows systems), and PowerShell (a scripting language used for the majority of our automation in IT) in our day-to-day work, and gain exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems.\nAfter your initial training, you’ll work in tandem with full-timers on two projects. While your projects may vary in scope and content, they are drawn directly from our team’s mission-critical stack and could include things like:\n\nDeveloping and maintaining tools and applications related to Windows automation and configuration management\nImproving our CI/CD systems, cross-platform frameworks, and software development environments\nImproving the efficiency and scalability of our tools, services, and monitoring solutions\nImplementing editor and workflow improvements to streamline coding and deployment workflows across IT\n\nAbout You\nWe don’t expect you to have a background in one specific field.
